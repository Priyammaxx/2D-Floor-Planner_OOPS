# Group Project for OOP course

'Mini Project' on Java Swing based GUI for OOP course, to be submitted before end-sem exams. But the development will still continue even after the course is over

## 2D Floor Planner

Something like autocad but in 2D only. Current scope:

- Can save and load files (to be implemented)
- Rooms, furniture, windows and doors (later, stairs too)
- change color, select, drag and drop, grid, snap and much more

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
