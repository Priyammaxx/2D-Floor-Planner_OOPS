# Group Project for OOP course

'Mini Project' for the course, to be submitted before end-sem exams. But the development will still continue even after the course is over

## 2D Floor Planner

Something like autocad but 2D only. Current scope:

- Can save and load files (to be implemented)
- Rooms, furniture, windows and doors (later, stairs too)
- change color, select, drag and drop, grid, snap and much more

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Run **SketchApp.java** to run program. Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency:

This project requires Gson and Gson extra library. Default VS Code build tools were used so libraries need to be added manually.

- [gson-2.11.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.11.0)
- [gson-extra-1.2.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.danilopianini/gson-extras/1.2.0)
